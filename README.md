Find Key:

You are provided with 3 numbers: input1, input2 and input3. Each of these are four digit numbers within the range >=1000 and <=9999.

i.e.

1000 <= input1 <= 9999

1000 <= input2 <= 9999

1000 <= input3 <= 9999

You are expected to find the Key using the below formula -

Key= [smallest digit in the thousands place of all three numbers] [smallest digit in the hundreds place of all three numbers] [smallest digit in the tens place of all three numbers] [smallest digit in the units place of all three numbers]

For e..g. if input1 = 3521, input2=2452, input3-1352, then Key = [1] [3] [2] [1] = 1321

Assuming that the 3 numbers are passed to the given function.

Complete the function to find and return the Key
